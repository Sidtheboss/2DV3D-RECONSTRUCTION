# 2DV3D-RECONSTRUCTION
This project demonstrates the implementation of face detection and image preprocessing techniques using Python. It combines the power of OpenCV, PyTorch, and NumPy to create a modular and flexible framework for working with image data.

Features
Image Preprocessing: Includes resizing, normalization, and transformations for machine learning readiness.
Face Detection: Utilizes Haar Cascade models for efficient face detection in images.
Modular Design: Clear separation of functionalities, making it easy to extend and adapt for custom applications.
Interactive Development: Compatible with Google Colab for seamless experimentation and learning.

Getting Started
The repository is beginner-friendly with detailed step-by-step guidance for running the code in both local and cloud environments (e.g., Colab).
